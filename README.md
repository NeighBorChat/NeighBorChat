# NeighBorChat
NOTE: still in the process of development ... 
## Why another chat app ???: 
- No DATA CENTER, no DATA BREAK ! => the data belong to you is "ONLY" store on your local machine
- No SERVER, no PROBLEMS ! => the data is sending directly from you to your friends
- No no (Yes) encryption, No one can read your messages! => Sending Messenger [encrypted](https://www.quintessencelabs.com/blog/breaking-rsa-encryption-update-state-art/#:~:text=It%20would%20take%20a%20classical,RSA%2D2048%20bit%20encryption%20key.) with RSA-2048 BITs !!! (it took yearS to crack your msg)
- No Old, 😀 😃 😄 😁 😆 😅 😂 🤣 and multi-languages supported
- No Cost, Free until the end !
## Instruction 
1. The app is deploy at [HERE](https://neighborchat.github.io/NeighBorChat/)  
2. Be patient, our app is slow 😅  
3. When open, remember to set your name on the prompt (we not have time to do it properly) or the app will be broke...  
4. Use your friend name and put in the Search bar on the top-left corner to find your friends, click the searched results to start chat.
Note: you need to open 2 browser to test chat your self, or ask your friends to tryout our BEST PRIVACY CHAT app :)
